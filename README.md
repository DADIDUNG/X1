# X1 Blockchain Node Instructions

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to hosting comprehensive instructions for setting up and running both read-only and full validator nodes on the X1 blockchain. 

The primary focus, at present, is on the Testnet phase of the X1 blockchain. Detailed guidelines cater to users interested in participating in this phase, either by running a read-only node for network support or by setting up a full validator node for more active involvement. 

As the X1 blockchain progresses toward its Mainnet launch, we will update this repository with relevant instructions and resources to facilitate an effortless transition and set up for the Mainnet.
